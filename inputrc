set bell-style none

# The bash equivalent for the tcsh 'set autolist ambiguous' is:
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# completion-query-items
#
#    The number of possible completions that determines when the user is
#    asked whether the list of possibilities should be displayed. If the
#    number of possible completions is greater than this value, Readline
#    will ask the user whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise,
#    they are simply listed. This variable must be set to an integer value
#    greater than or equal to 0. A negative value means Readline should
#    never ask (This is only for bash 3.2!). The default limit is 100.
set completion-query-items 1000000000

# page-completions
# If set to On, readline uses an internal more-like pager#
# to  display  a  screenful  of possible completions at a
# time.
set page-completions off

# mark-symlinked-directories
#    If set to 'on', completed names which are symbolic links to directories
#    have a slash appended (subject to the value of mark-directories). The
#    default is 'off'.
#
set mark-symlinked-directories on

set visible-stats on

# If set to On, readline tries to enable the keyboard's application keypad
# when it is called. Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys. The
# default is Off.
